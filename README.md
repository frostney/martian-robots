# martian-robots

Command-line tool to path out the way for a robot on Mars

## Usage

## Motivation

- No compilation step

## General thoughts

- Wish I would have been able to use the `import` syntax, but `import-jsx` hooks into `require` making it incompatible to use ES2015 imports
- I couldn't figure out how to use Yarn 2 PnP in Node.js or if it's even possible
- I wish I could have been able to use Recoil, but unfortunately it depends on `react-dom` (https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/issues/99) making it impossible to use with other renderers

## Things to improve on
